**2. Key Findings, Analysis and Indentified Business Problems**

### Analysis and Identified Business Problems

**a. Employee Performance**:
- **Top Employees**: Paul Turner emerged as the highest-performing employee, contributing significantly to sales, generated $100,645 in sales, while others have significantly lower contributions.
- **Job Title Contributions**: Sales representetive at various levels accounted for the highest portion of total sales.
- **Problem**: The disparity in employee performance might be linked to inadequate training, differences in client engagement, or unequal distribution of resources and opportunities.

**b. Regional and State Analysis**:
- **Top Region**: The South Central East region leads with $475K in total sales, surpassing all other regions. This regionâ€™s dominance suggests strong customer demand and effective sales strategies.
- **Top State**: Texas recorded the highest state-level sales, driven by a combination of high population and effective employee contributions.
- **Underperforming Regions**: The North Central West region showed the lowest sales ($22K), indicating potential gaps in market penetration or resource allocation.

- **Problem**: The lack of sales in underperforming regions could be due to insufficient marketing, limited employee presence, or poor customer outreach strategies.

**c. Product-Level Insights**:
- **Product Performance**: Mineral Water emerged as a top-performing category, accounting for $1.25M in sales, dominating over Supplements ($619K) and Fitness products ($464K).
- **Order Type**: Wholesale sales dominate (78.5%), highlighting the importance of bulk transactions in driving revenue. Retail (21.5%) still represents a growth opportunity.

- **Problem**: Heavy reliance on one product category could expose the business to risks if market trends shift. Additionally, opportunities for growth in Supplements and Fitness may be underexplored.

**d. Sales Trends**:
- **Monthly Performance**: Sales peaked in early 2022, with consistent performance trends visible across months.
- **Impact of Employee Count**: A positive correlation between employee count and regional sales suggests that workforce size significantly influences sales output.
- **Highest Sales** Month: December consistently records the highest sales, with a peak of $136,874 in 2022. This is attributed to the holiday season, which drives increased consumer spending for festive shopping, gift-giving, and end-of-year corporate budget allocations. Both retail and wholesale transactions see a significant uptick during this time.

- **Lowest Sales Month**: July and October typically experiences the low sales,  $72,657 in July 2022 and $67,345 in October 2021. This slump can be linked to consumer focus on summer vacations and outdoor activities, resulting in reduced shopping. A lack of targeted summer promotions may also contribute to this decline. And the dip in sales in October is likely due to the gap between back-to-school spending in September and the onset of holiday shopping in November. Consumer spending during this time may be restrained as individuals prepare for end-of-year expenses.
